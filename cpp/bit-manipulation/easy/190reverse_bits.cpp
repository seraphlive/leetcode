 *
 * Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
 * In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type.
 * They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary
 * representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
 * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement
 * notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed
 * integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
 * Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
 * Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100
 * represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its
 * binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
 * Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
 * Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101
 * represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its
 * binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The input must be a binary string of length 32
