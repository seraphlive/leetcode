 * Testcase Example:  '5'
 *
 * Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement
 * strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: num = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
 * and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: num = 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
 * its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit
 * signed integer.
 * num >= 1
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
 * representation.
 * This question is the same as 1009:
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

// @lc code=start
// XOR with 1s can flip all the bits, but leading zero should not be flipped.
// So we need to find the highest bit of 1 in num and make a mask of 1s.
class Solution {
 public:
  int findComplement(int num) {
    int mask = num;
    mask |= (mask >> 1);
    mask |= (mask >> 2);
    mask |= (mask >> 4);
    mask |= (mask >> 8);
    mask |= (mask >> 16);
    return (num ^ mask);
  }
};
